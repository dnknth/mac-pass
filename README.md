# Pass

A simple [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) menu for MacOS

People who like to keep their passwords to themselves use [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org). However, a decent MacOS integration
seemed to be wanting.

Pass is a simple menu dropdown that copies the selected password
to the clipboard for the configured amount of time (or 45 seconds).

## Credits

The app was made with [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus), a great way to turn some measly lines of code into a full blown Mac app.

The shell script borrows from [passmenu](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/dmenu/passmenu).
